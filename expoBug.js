While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server would randomly stop responding, requiring a manual restart. This occurred inconsistently across different projects and platforms (iOS and Android simulators).  The error logs provided little insight, only showing a generic 'connection closed' message. Attempts to debug by checking network settings, firewall rules, and Expo CLI version updates proved unsuccessful. The problem manifested independently of specific code changes within the application.
